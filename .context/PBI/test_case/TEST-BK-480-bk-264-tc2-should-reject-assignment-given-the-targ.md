**Jira Key:** [BK-480](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-480)
**Status:** Candidate
**Components:** Bugs & Defect Heatmap

## Test Description

## Related Story

BK-264 — TMS-Defect Triage | Assign a defect to a workspace member and update its status

## Priority / ROI

- Priority: High
- ROI score: 8.0 (Frequency 4 x Impact 4 x Stability 3 / Effort 2 x Dependencies 3)
- Outcome: Candidate

## Prior bugs covered

None — zero bugs found during BK-264's sprint-testing execution pass.

## Test Design

### Preconditions

- Actor is authenticated with at least Member-level access to the workspace
- Target bug exists in the workspace (any status)
- Target user id is not a member of the workspace (never invited)

### Action

Actor POSTs `/api/v1/bugs/{bug*id}/assign` with `{ assignee*user*id: {non*member*user*id} }`

### Expected Results

- Response is 422 with `code: "validation*failed"`, `details.reason: "assignee*not*workspace*member"`
- `bugs.assignee*user*id` is unchanged after the rejected request

### Gherkin (if Candidate)

Scenario: should reject assignment given the target is not a workspace member
  """
  Related Story: BK-264
  """

  # === PRECONDITIONS ===
  Given a bug exists with status "open" in workspace "{workspace_id}"
  And "{non*member*user*id}" is not a member of "{workspace*id}"

  # === ACTION ===
  When the actor POSTs "/api/v1/bugs/{bug*id}/assign" with { assignee*user*id: "{non*member*user*id}" }

  # === VALIDATIONS ===
  Then the response is 422 with reason "assignee*not*workspace_member"
  And the bug's assignee*user*id remains unchanged
```

## Variables

| Variable | How to obtain |
| --- | --- |
| `{workspace_id}` | Workspace where the actor has >= Member access |
| `{bug*id}` | A bug in `{workspace*id}` (any status) |
| `{non*member*user*id}` | A user id with no `workspace*members` row in `{workspace_id}` |

## Implementation Code

| Layer | File |
| --- | --- |
| API component | (pending — filled by test-automation) |
| UI component | N/A — API-only TC |
| Test file | (pending) |
| Fixture | (pending) |

## Architecture

API-only — `POST /api/v1/bugs/{id}/assign`. Follows KATA ApiBase layer.

## Available Test IDs (UI)

N/A (API-only TC)

## Refinement Notes

Empirically validated against staging on 2026-08-14 (`/sprint-testing` Stage 2 execution, outline #2) — assigning to a never-invited user id returned 422 with reason `assignee*not*workspace_member`, matching `lib/bugs/errors.ts` SQLSTATE 45312 mapping. No discrepancy.
